2 solutions, 1 using pytorch and one using fastAI, both share the same mutihead model, both use timm vision models.

Pytorch Solution:
 Multihead model: forward returns (label,variety) tuple  
 DataSet: __getitem__ returns image,lbl,variety
 loss function: __call__ takes a preds tuple and correct_labels,correct_varieties
 TIMM model extended to provide 2 outputs.
 Learning rate selected via optuna optimizer

FastAI port
 Uses above model and loss
 Learning rate selected via fastai learning rate finder


Observations:
Fastai learning rate finder is much faster and easier to use than optuna
